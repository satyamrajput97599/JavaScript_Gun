<!-- Dom :- The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for manipulating HTML and XML documents. (add, remove, and modify parts of the document/HTML) 

* When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the Page

Note: In this DOM tree, the document is the root node or object.

* With the Object model, javascript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

* Javascript can change all the HTML elements in the page

* Javascript can change all the HTML attributes in the page

* Javascript can change all the CSS style in the page

* Javascript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes

* Javascript can add new HTML elements and attributes

* Javascript can react to all existing HTML events in the page

* Javascript can create new HTML events in the Page

* Note:- In the DOM all HTML elements are define as objects. so it will have both property and method

* The document object represents your web page

* If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.
