How we will proceed

1. Understand Object Oriented concept in real life
2. Understand Object Oriented concept in Programming (procedural vs object Oriented)
3. Four pillar of Object Oriented Programming (important for interview)
4. Old object Oriented Programming in JavaScript till ES5
5. New Class feature in ES6


Understand Object Oriented Concept in real life

Three important words to Understand
1. Object
2. Class
3. Inheritance


Object :- 
In this world every thing is a object (living things and non living things)

Example: satyam (man), Honda city (car)

Every Object has 2 things:

1. Features or Properties
2. Actions Performed by or Performed on it

* Satyam (man)

1. Feature or Properties:- full name, height, weight, age
2. Actions :- walk, eat, sleep

* Honda city (car)
1. Feature or Properties :- name, color, model, brand
2. Actions :- drive, repair, fuel filling



Class - (Grouping of object)

satyam (man) - satyam is a object of man class,
JeffBezos (man) - satyam is a object of man class,
Elon musk (man) - satyam is a object of man class,


Class (Man)

1. features or Properties :- full name, height, weight
2. action :- walk, eat

class (software engineer)
1. feature or properties :- full name, employee id, year of experience, expertise
2. action :- code, text, debug, deploy

Problem: Satyam is a object of Software engineer class and a object of man class.

============ Inheritance ==============

Class (Man)

1. features or Properties :- full name, height, weight, age
2. action :- walk, eat

class (software engineer inherit man class)

1. feature or properties :- employee id, year of experience, expertise
2. action :- code, text, debug, deploy

satyam(Software engineer)



***** Object Oriented Programming(OOP) **************

In OOP concept we group function and variable and variable in a Block Called Class

This is not the Exact Syntax



=========== Four pillars of oBject Oriented Programming ===================
====================(important for interview)===================

1. Encapsulation :-  Encapsulation means wrapping up data and member function (Method) together into a single unit class.

2. Abstraction :- Abstraction is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of an entity/Object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information. For Example to open your TV we only have a power button, it is not understand how infra-red waves are getting generated in Tv remote control.

3. Inheritance :- Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to acquire the properties and behavior of another class (super-class). It helps to reuse, customize and enhance the existing code. So it helps to write a code accurately and reduce the development time.

4. Polymorphism :- Sp Polymorphism means "many forms". A subclass can subclass can define its own unique behavior and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class.


class square(){                                            class circle(){
    area()                                                       area()        
}                                                               }

Var 1 = new square();                                           Var C1 = new circle()
S1->area();                                                     C1->area();
