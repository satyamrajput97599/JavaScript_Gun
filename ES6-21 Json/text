JSON :- JSON is a text format for storing and transporting Data Commonly user for API and config files.

JSON syntax is derived from javascript object notation syntax:

Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays
{
    "name" : "Satyam Chauhan,
    "age" : 22,
    "lang" " ["c","C++","java","php"]
}

JSON is Language independent
(Code for reading and generating JSON exists in many programming Languages.)

Earlier XML was used instead of JSON

Then why JSON

* JSON is faster in term of data parsing
* JSON is cleaner than XML
* JSON is light weight than xml
* Easy to read and write
